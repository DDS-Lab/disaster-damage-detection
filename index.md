# Automatic Damage Annotation on Post-Hurricane Satellite Imagery

The goal of this project is to use post hurricane satellite imagery data to 
train a machine learning algorithm to automatically detect damages from 
satellite images after hurricanes. Our goal is to develop a model that improves 
the damage assessment process for emergency managers. 

Specifically, we:

1. Gather, clean and prepare training datasets with annotations for damaged buildings and test datasets
   
2. Train the machine learning algorithm using the training data

3. Test the model on a test dataset
