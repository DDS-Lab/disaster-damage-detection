For each training that we conducted, we were able to view the training loss and precision via the Tensorboard shown below:

1. Satellite RGB Imagery from Digital Globe using Single Shot Detector (SSD)

![Damaged](damaged-sat.png)![Undamaged](undamaged-sat.png)

2. Aerial RGB Imagery from NOAA and FEMA

Green bounding boxes indicate non-damaged buildings and the other colored bounding boxes indicate damaged buildings of varying degrees.
