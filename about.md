Global climate change from greenhouse gas emissions is causing an increase in the intensity and frequency of hurricane events. Evidence for this is presented by the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/).  One implications for emergency managers is the pressing need to develop a tool that is faster than the weeks it can take for damage assessment using windshield surveys.  A tool that can automatically detect damages from post-hurricane satellite imagery could reduce the time required for damage assessment to 24 hours.  This could serve to triage and further optimize disaster response efforts.
